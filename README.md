# ML-Yield-Analysis-Semiconductor
This project predicts semiconductor yield using the UCI SECOM dataset. Applied PCA (90% variance) for dimensionality reduction, SMOTE for class balancing, and Random Forest, achieving 99.48% accuracy. Identified key principal components and top features for better interpretability.
